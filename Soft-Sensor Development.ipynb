    "### 1. What is soft-sensor and why we need it\n",
    "Soft-sensors are online analyzers used to monitor certain critical variables in the process without having to take samples and perform high cost measurement frequently.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. How do we do that?\n",
    "We build soft sensor by modeling process hostorical log data with the limited amount of measured samples and try to best correlate process variable with target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is this noteook for?\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use a pseudo process dataset and applying python programming on the dataset. In order to cover the most skill set required for modeling soft sensor, we will also talk about data preprocessing, visualization and some machine learning concepts.  \n",

    "## B.How to Utilize Jupyter Notebook <span id='jptnb'></span> \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. User Interface\n",
    "You can find most frequently used functions within toolbar on the top left corner. The python logo on the top right indicates that this notebook is built with python syntax.\n",
    "<img src='images/toolbar.JPG' width='850'>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Code Cells\n",
    "One advantage of Jupyter Notebook is that you can analyze and run the code cell by cell. Every cell is independent to some extent, you can run cells according to customized sequence or run all at once if you want. Of course, variables are shared within the notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you wish to run a single cell, click in that cell and presss **shift+enter**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Markdown Cells\n",
    "Another advanage of Jupyter Notebook is that you can insert markdown cell between code cells. Markdown is a markup language that is frequently used in documenting. You can illustrate anything you want others to know through the markdown cell like I am doing now. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Sequence of Execution\n",
    "Please refer to picture below. The number in front of each cell indicates the sequence of execution. You do not have to run cells one by one from top to down. You can run in any order you want, just to make sure it could.\n",
    "<img src='images/py_seq.JPG' width='550'>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Errors\n",
    "If an error occurs during execution of cells, error messages will show up, just like picture below, to tell you where the error occurs and why it occurs. Try to fix the bug and re-run it!\n",
    "<img src='images/py_error.JPG' width='850'>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Check Files\n",
    "You can click on the Jupyter logo on the top left or \"Open link in new tab\" to visit the file system of Jupyter.\n",

    "- **Acquire Data:**<br>\n",
    "After receiving original data from client or internal department is the start of the whole process. Because this is the original data, it could be messy and not well-structured. That's why we need to do the following preprocessing before going directly into modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing:**<br>\n",
    "In order to make our raw data usable, preprocessing is a essential step to achieve the goal. Typically, preprocessing includes <font style='color:red'>***data integration, data cleaning, data transformation and data reduction*** </font>(You may hear different versions but that's fine).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:**<br>\n",
    "Feature engineering is a very critical part in data modeling for it brings extra information from original data. The spirit of feature engineering is to create new variable from original data or transform original data in certain way that better describes the variable. For instance, product to feed ratio and pressure compensation temperature are two examples that we already applied in our previous project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modeling:**<br>\n",
    "Here we will use linear models for the soft-sensor development. Three kinds of models will be introduced while we will focus mostly on partial-least-square regression (PLSR) because of some explicit advantages to apply it in process industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing and Going Online:**<br>\n",
    "After models are trained, it's time to test their ability to deal with fresh, unseen data. If the result is accepable, we could start implement the model to our system either by directly coding into DCS or indirectly by OPC (or other connetion method) to other software(This is how we do in APC project)\n",

    "\n",

    "In this training, we will only talk about linear regression because according to our experience, linear regression is enough to modeling process variables. Besides, nonlinear modeling is relatively hard to implement and maintain. In this part, three major algorithms of linear regression will be mnetioned. They are multi-linear regression, principal component regression and finally partial least square regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Linear Regression\n",
    "This is one of the most common algorithm for linear regression. The algorithm aims at finding minimum summation of squared residuals, and this is also called ordinary least square method. Firstly, you can imagine the results y are multiplication of two matrix X(independent variables) and B(coefficients). Then, apply linear algebra to solve for B. You may get this result.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we've mentioned before, outliers removal could be a part of data cleaning, but that's not a must. You can always perform outlier removal provided that it is required. Below lists some timing and strategy for outliers removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **During data preprocessing:** When you \"obersve\" something abnormal, you may flag it as an outlier and remove it. Some common cases are extreme out of bound value or a shaking point in continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **During exploratory data analysis:** During EDA, you will perform visualization of data which is convenient for capturing outliers. For example, if you found a point that is totally out of trend between X and Y in a scatter plot or there are data points far far away from normal range in histogram.\n",
    "<img src='images/scatter_outlier.JPG' align='left' width='300'> <img src='images/hist_outlier.JPG'>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **During modeling:** Sometimes something would not appear until modeling. Therefore, you may check the model while doing you first time modeling and check if there are point against the trend or poor being poorly described. However, it is not recommended that you pick out outliers just to make your model metrics better. \n",
    "<img src='images/poorlydescribed.JPG' width='400'>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font style='color:red'>**Remember, removing outliers is to ensure those points would not severely interfere the behavior of generalized model, not to make the metrics(such as RMSE) better and better.**</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drop rows\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to drop certain rows during outlier detection(or any other steps, of course), you may use function below to achieve that. You can adjust the index within the list to designate rows to drop.\n",
